<h1>Victims & Volunteers</h1>


<ol>
	<li>First prompt the user to ask how many disaster victims they wish to enter.</li>
	<li>For each disaster victim that will be added, prompt the user to enter their name, phone number, and street. You don't need to validate the information. Add each newly entered user to three arrays, one for each piece of information, using array.push.</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 1 and 2, but this time you are asking for volunteers. You'll need a separate set of arrays.</li>
	<li>At the end, print out, in a single alert, the number of persons in need, the number of volunteers, and a list of all persons in need and all volunteers. You may format this in any way that looks reasonable.</li>
</ol>
